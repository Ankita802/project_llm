"As a CONNECT adopter I want Release Notes for 4.3 to be documented on the wiki, so that I understand the features, bug fixes packaged with this release","The Release Notes for CONNECT 4.3 are documented on the wiki, detailing new features, bug fixes, and improvements. This includes enhancements to the Setup Wizard, updates to the core codebase, and security improvements. The documentation helps adopters understand the changes and how they impact their implementation."
"As a Developer, I want to prevent duplicate transactions from being published and deal with the time gap between validation and the publishing decision.","The developer aims to implement a mechanism to prevent the publication of duplicate transactions and address the time gap between validation and the publishing decision. This involves creating a system that identifies and filters out duplicate transactions before they are published, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy. Additionally, strategies will be devised to manage the time delay between validation and publishing, possibly through automated workflows or notification systems to streamline the process and ensure timely decision-making."
"As a Custodial Agent we need to reduce the amount of up-front policy and planning for security requirements and what is assigned to the implementers, this should be largely predetermined for all implementers and simplified.","Establish a standardized security framework that encompasses essential security requirements applicable to all implementations. This framework should cover key areas such as access control, data encryption, authentication mechanisms, and logging practices. Preconfigured Security Profiles: Develop preconfigured security profiles or templates tailored to different implementation scenarios. These profiles should encapsulate predefined security settings aligned with industry best practices and regulatory standards. Implementers can select the appropriate profile based on their deployment needs, reducing the need for manual configuration. Automated Security Setup: Implement automation tools and scripts to streamline the setup and configuration of security measures. Automate routine tasks such as user provisioning, access control policy enforcement, and security policy enforcement to minimize manual intervention and potential errors. Comprehensive Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation outlining the predefined security requirements, recommended configurations, and deployment guidelines. This documentation should serve as a reference for implementers, offering clear instructions on how to meet security standards without extensive planning or policy formulation. Training and Support: Offer training sessions, workshops, or online resources to educate implementers on security best practices and the use of predefined security profiles. Ensure that implementers have access to support channels where they can seek assistance or clarification regarding security-related queries. Continuous Compliance Monitoring: Implement mechanisms for continuous compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to predefined security standards post-deployment. Utilize automated monitoring tools and periodic audits to identify deviations from established security policies and address them promptly. Feedback Mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from implementers regarding the effectiveness and usability of predefined security measures. Use this feedback to iteratively refine security profiles and streamline the implementation process further. Collaboration with Stakeholders: Collaborate closely with stakeholders, including security experts, regulatory bodies, and industry partners, to validate and refine the predefined security framework. Engage in ongoing discussions to align security requirements with evolving threats and emerging technologies."
"As a Publisher, I would like a tool to check data availability persistence after publication.","As a Publisher, I need a tool to verify the persistence of data availability after publication."" This user story succinctly conveys the requirement for a tool to ensure that published data remains available and accessible over time, addressing the concerns of data persistence."
