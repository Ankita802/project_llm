```python
def update_submission_updates(submission_id, new_status):
    # Fetch the FABS submission based on submission_id
    submission = fetch_submission(submission_id)

    # Modify the updates field based on the new_status
    submission['updates'].append({
        'timestamp': datetime.now(),

"As a Developer, I want to prevent users from double publishing FABS submissions after refreshing, so that there are no duplicates.
","To prevent users from double publishing FABS (Form, Application, Button, or Submission) submissions after refreshing, you can implement a few strategies:

1. Disable the submit button after the first submission: Once the user submits the form, disable the submit button to prevent further submissions. This can be achieved by adding a CSS class or setting the button's `disabled` attribute to `true`.

2. Use a server-side check: When a submission is received, store a unique identifier (e.g., a session ID or a timestamp) associated with that submission on the server. On subsequent submissions, check if the identifier already exists. If it does, reject the submission as a duplicate.

3. Implement a client-side check: Store a unique identifier in the user's browser (e.g., using cookies or local storage) when a submission is made. Before allowing a new submission, check if the identifier already exists. If it does, prevent the submission from being sent.

4. Implement a confirmation page: After the user submits the form, redirect them to a confirmation page. This way, refreshing the page won't trigger a duplicate submission. The confirmation page can display a success message and provide additional information or actions.

5. Use a form token: Generate a unique token for each form submission and include it as a hidden field in the form. When a submission is received, check if the token has already been used. If it has, reject the submission as a duplicate.

Remember to combine these strategies to provide a robust solution. Client-side checks can improve user experience by preventing unnecessary server requests, but server-side checks are essential for security and to handle cases where users bypass client-side checks.",

"As a FABS user, I want to have my validations run in a reasonable amount of time.
","As a FABS user, you can ensure that your validations run in a reasonable amount of time by following these best practices:

1. Optimize your code: Make sure your code is efficient and well-optimized. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize the time complexity of your validations.

2. Limit the scope of your validations: Only validate the necessary data and fields. Avoid validating unnecessary data that doesn't impact the outcome of your validations.

3. Use indexing: If you are performing validations on large datasets, consider using indexing techniques to speed up the process. Indexing allows for faster data retrieval and can significantly improve the performance of your validations.

4. Batch processing: If possible, process your validations in batches instead of individually. This can help reduce the overall processing time by minimizing the overhead of repeated operations.

5. Use caching: If your validations involve repetitive calculations or lookups, consider caching the results. Caching can help avoid redundant computations and improve the overall performance of your validations.

6. Parallel processing: If your validations can be performed independently, consider parallelizing the process. This involves dividing the workload among multiple threads or processes, allowing for faster execution.

7. Regularly review and optimize: Continuously review and optimize your validation code. Identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal performance.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your validations run efficiently and within a reasonable amount of time.",

"As a collection curator, I want to be able require authentication to access objects unless the request is coming from a whitelisted IP address, list of addresses.
","To require authentication to access objects unless the request is coming from a whitelisted IP address or a list of addresses, you can implement the following steps:

1. Set up an authentication system: Implement a user authentication system that requires users to provide valid credentials (e.g., username and password) to access the objects in your collection. This can be done using various authentication methods such as username/password, API keys, or tokens.

2. Create a whitelist of IP addresses: Maintain a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access the objects without authentication. This whitelist should include the IP addresses that you trust and want to grant direct access to.

3. Check the request's IP address: Whenever a request is made to access an object, retrieve the IP address of the requester. This can typically be obtained from the request headers.

4. Verify the IP address: Compare the requester's IP address with the whitelist of IP addresses. If the IP address matches any entry in the whitelist, allow access to the object without requiring authentication. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

5. Authenticate the user: If the requester's IP address is not whitelisted, prompt the user to provide valid authentication credentials. Verify the provided credentials against your authentication system. If the credentials are valid, grant access to the requested object. Otherwise, deny access.

By implementing these steps, you can ensure that only requests coming from whitelisted IP addresses can bypass authentication and directly access the objects in your collection. Other requests will require proper authentication before granting access.",

"As a dataset developer, I want to separate the interface from the implementation of a dataset type.
","To separate the interface from the implementation of a dataset type as a dataset developer, you can follow the principles of object-oriented programming and use abstraction and encapsulation.

1. Define an interface: Start by defining an interface that represents the functionality and behavior of the dataset type. This interface should include the methods and properties that are common to all dataset implementations. For example, you might have methods like `loadData()`, `getData()`, `saveData()`, etc.

2. Implement the interface: Create concrete classes that implement the interface. Each class will provide its own implementation of the methods defined in the interface. These classes will represent different types of datasets or different ways of storing and accessing data. For example, you might have classes like `CSVDataSet`, `DatabaseDataSet`, `JSONDataSet`, etc.

3. Use dependency injection: Instead of directly instantiating the concrete classes, use dependency injection to provide the dataset implementation to the client code. This allows you to easily switch between different dataset implementations without modifying the client code. For example, you can pass an instance of the dataset implementation to a client class through its constructor or a setter method.

4. Program to the interface: In your client code, program to the interface rather than the concrete implementation. This means that you should use the methods and properties defined in the interface to interact with the dataset, rather than relying on specific implementation details. This allows you to decouple the client code from the dataset implementation and makes it easier to switch between different implementations.

By separating the interface from the implementation of a dataset type, you can achieve better code organization, maintainability, and flexibility. It also allows for easier testing and promotes code reusability.",
"As an app developer, I want to only depend on the interface of a dataset type in my app and have the system inject the implementation at runtime.
","To achieve this, you can use the concept of dependency injection in your app. Dependency injection allows you to decouple the implementation of a dependency from its usage, making your code more modular and flexible.

Here's how you can implement dependency injection for the dataset type in your app:

1. Define an interface for the dataset type:
   ```java
   public interface Dataset {
       // Define the methods required by your app
   }
   ```

2. Implement the dataset interface with different implementations:
   ```java
   public class LocalDataset implements Dataset {
       // Implement the methods using a local data source
   }

   public class RemoteDataset implements Dataset {
       // Implement the methods using a remote data source
   }
   ```

3. Create a dependency injection container or framework:
   You can either use an existing dependency injection framework like Dagger, Guice, or Spring, or create a simple container yourself.

   ```java
   public class DatasetContainer {
       private static Dataset dataset;

       public static Dataset getDataset() {
           if (dataset == null) {
               // Instantiate the desired implementation based on some condition
               if (/* condition to use local dataset */) {
                   dataset = new LocalDataset();
               } else {
                   dataset = new RemoteDataset();
               }
           }
           return dataset;
       }
   }
   ```

4. Use the dataset interface in your app:
   Instead of directly instantiating the dataset implementation, you can retrieve it from the container.

   ```java
   public class MyApp {
       private Dataset dataset;

       public MyApp() {
           dataset = DatasetContainer.getDataset();
       }

       // Use the dataset methods in your app
   }
   ```

By following this approach, your app will only depend on the dataset interface, and the specific implementation will be injected at runtime based on your conditions or configuration. This allows you to easily switch between different dataset implementations without modifying your app's code.",
"As an app developer, I want to write unit tests for an app that depends on the interface of a dataset type.
","To write unit tests for an app that depends on the interface of a dataset type, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the dataset interface: Determine the methods and properties that the dataset type should provide to your app. This could include methods for retrieving data, updating data, or performing other operations on the dataset.

2. Create a mock dataset implementation: Since you are writing unit tests, you don't want to rely on the actual dataset implementation for testing. Instead, create a mock dataset implementation that adheres to the dataset interface. This mock implementation should mimic the behavior of the real dataset type but with simplified functionality.

"As a system administrator, I want to run a script that tests to see if a Neurohub installation is functioning correctly.
","To test if a Neurohub installation is functioning correctly, you can create a script that performs various checks. Here's an example of a script that you can run as a system administrator:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Neurohub service is running
if systemctl is-active --quiet neurohub.service; then
    echo ""Neurohub service is running.""
else
    echo ""Neurohub service is not running.""
fi

# Check if Neurohub web interface is accessible
if curl --output /dev/null --silent --head --fail http://localhost:8080; then
    echo ""Neurohub web interface is accessible.""
else
    echo ""Neurohub web interface is not accessible.""
fi

# Check if required dependencies are installed
required_packages=(""package1"" ""package2"" ""package3"")
missing_packages=()

for package in ""${required_packages[@]}""; do
    if ! dpkg -s ""$package"" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        missing_packages+=(""$package"")
    fi
done

if [ ${#missing_packages[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo ""All required packages are installed.""
else
    echo ""Missing packages: ${missing_packages[*]}""
fi

# Add more checks as needed

```

This script checks if the Neurohub service is running, if the web interface is accessible, and if all the required dependencies are installed. You can add more checks specific to your Neurohub installation as needed.

Save the script to a file (e.g., `neurohub_test.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x neurohub_test.sh`), and then run it as a system administrator (`./neurohub_test.sh`). The script will provide output indicating the status of the Neurohub installation based on the performed checks.",
"As a release engineer, I want to call a script to execute acceptance tests against a Neurohub installation and report back the results.
","To achieve this, I would create a script that calls the acceptance test suite for the Neurohub installation. This script would execute the tests and capture the results, such as pass/fail status and any error messages. The script would then report back the results to the release engineer, potentially through an automated notification system or by generating a report.

Additionally, I would ensure that the script is integrated into the release process, so that it is automatically triggered whenever a new Neurohub installation is deployed. This would allow for continuous monitoring of the acceptance tests and provide immediate feedback to the release engineer.

By implementing this process, the release engineer can have confidence in the quality of the Neurohub installation and quickly address any issues that arise during the acceptance testing phase.",
"As an investigator, I want to view the acceptance test results, so that I can understand how feature-complete the Neurohub node currently is.
","To view the acceptance test results and understand the feature completeness of the Neurohub node, you can follow these steps:

1. Obtain access to the acceptance test results: Contact the development team or the project manager responsible for the Neurohub node. Request access to the acceptance test results, which may be stored in a test management tool, a version control system, or a dedicated test results repository.

2. Review the test plan: Familiarize yourself with the test plan for the Neurohub node. This document outlines the scope of testing, test objectives, and the features to be tested. It will help you understand which aspects of the node have been covered in the acceptance tests.

3. Analyze the test results: Open the acceptance test results and examine the test cases executed, their status (pass/fail), and any associated defects or issues. Pay attention to the test coverage and the number of passed and failed tests.

4. Identify the test coverage: Assess the extent to which the acceptance tests cover the desired features and functionality of the Neurohub node. Look for any gaps or areas that have not been adequately tested.

5. Evaluate the test outcomes: Analyze the pass/fail status of the acceptance tests. Identify any critical or high-priority failures that may indicate incomplete or non-functional features. Take note of any failed tests that may require further investigation.

6. Communicate with the development team: If you have any questions or concerns about the acceptance test results, reach out to the development team. Discuss any issues or failures you have identified and seek clarification on the current state of feature completeness.

7. Consider additional testing: Based on your analysis of the acceptance test results, determine if any additional testing is required to ensure the feature completeness of the Neurohub node. This may involve creating new test cases, executing specific tests, or conducting exploratory testing.

By following these steps, you can gain insights into the feature completeness of the Neurohub node based on the acceptance test results and collaborate with the development team to address any identified issues.",
"As an MRI operator, I want to digitally record the responses that subjects make when completing paper-based forms.
","This would allow for easier data management and analysis, as well as reducing the risk of errors associated with manual data entry. Additionally, digital recording would provide a more efficient way to track and monitor subjects' responses over time. This could be achieved by using software that allows for the scanning and digitization of paper forms, or by implementing electronic forms that can be completed and recorded directly on a computer or tablet. By digitizing the responses, MRI operators can streamline their workflow and improve the overall efficiency of data collection and analysis.",
"As a user, I want to navigate forwards and backwards between log books and log book pages without having to use my browser's back button.
","User Story: Log Book Navigation

Description:
As a user, I want to be able to navigate forwards and backwards between log books and log book pages without having to rely on my browser's back button. This will provide a more seamless and efficient user experience.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The application should provide a clear and intuitive navigation menu or toolbar.
2. The navigation menu or toolbar should include options to go back to the previous log book or log book page.
3. Clicking on the ""Back"" button in the navigation menu or toolbar should take the user to the previous log book or log book page they were on.
4. The application should remember the user's navigation history, allowing them to go back multiple steps if needed.
5. The navigation menu or toolbar should also include options to go forward to the next log book or log book page, if applicable.
6. Clicking on the ""Forward"" button in the navigation menu or toolbar should take the user to the next log book or log book page they were on, if applicable.
7. The application should handle cases where there is no previous or next log book or log book page, disabling the corresponding navigation buttons.

"As an archivist, I want to distinguish between images scanned in color or black and white, so that I know whether or not these images meet publication requirements.
","To distinguish between color and black and white images, you can follow these steps as an archivist:

1. Visual Inspection: Start by visually examining the images to identify any obvious differences in color or lack thereof. Look for vibrant or muted colors, shades of gray, or absence of color.

2. File Format: Check the file format of the images. Color images are typically saved in formats like JPEG, TIFF, PNG, or RAW, while black and white images are often saved as TIFF, PNG, or GIF. However, note that this method alone may not be foolproof as both color and black and white images can be saved in various formats.

3. Metadata: Examine the metadata associated with the images. Metadata can provide information about the image, including color space, color profile, or color mode. Color images may have metadata indicating RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space, while black and white images may have grayscale or indexed color mode.

4. Histogram Analysis: Utilize image editing software or tools that offer histogram analysis. Open the image in the software and check the histogram. Color images will typically show a distribution of colors across the RGB spectrum, while black and white images will have a more concentrated distribution in the grayscale range.

5. Color Sampling: Select a small area of the image that represents the overall content and use the color sampling tool in image editing software to check the color values. If the sampled area shows a range of colors, it is likely a color image. If the sampled area shows only shades of gray, it is likely a black and white image.

By combining these methods, you should be able to distinguish between color and black and white images accurately. Remember to cross-verify your findings using multiple techniques to ensure the images meet your publication requirements.",

"As a Cornell faculty member, I want to be notified if someone downloads any of my items or files, so that I can follow usage and see what others are most interested in reading.
","To be notified when someone downloads your items or files, you can set up Google Analytics tracking on your website or file hosting platform. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Sign up for a Google Analytics account if you don't have one already. Visit the Google Analytics website (https://analytics.google.com) and follow the instructions to create an account.

2. Once you have an account, create a new property for tracking your downloads. Provide the necessary information about your website or file hosting platform.

3. After creating the property, you'll receive a tracking ID. It will look like ""UA-XXXXXXXX-X"". Make a note of this ID.

4. Install the Google Analytics tracking code on your website or file hosting platform. If you have a website, you can add the tracking code to the header or footer of your web pages. If you're using a file hosting platform, check if they have an option to add custom tracking code.

5. Modify the tracking code to track file downloads specifically. Add the following code snippet to the tracking code on the pages where you want to track downloads:

```javascript
<script>
  function trackDownloads(url) {
    ga('send', 'event', 'Download', 'click', url);
  }
</script>
```

6. Replace the existing `ga('send', 'pageview')` line in the tracking code with `ga('send', 'pageview', location.pathname + location.search + location.hash);`.

7. On your website or file hosting platform, identify the links or buttons that allow users to download your files. Add the `onclick` attribute to those links or buttons, calling the `trackDownloads` function and passing the file URL as a parameter. For example:

```html
<a href=""your-file.pdf"" onclick=""trackDownloads('your-file.pdf')"">Download PDF</a>
```

8. Save the changes to your website or file hosting platform, and the tracking will be active.

Now, whenever someone clicks on a download link, Google Analytics will record it as an event. You can access this data in your Google Analytics account under the ""Behavior"" section, specifically in the ""Events"" reports. It will show you the number of downloads for each file and other related information.

Remember to comply with Cornell University's data privacy policies and any other applicable regulations when tracking user data.",
