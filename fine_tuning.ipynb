These classes will represent different types of datasets or different ways of storing and accessing data. For example, you might have classes like `CSVDataSet`, `DatabaseDataSet`, `JSONDataSet`, etc.\n",

      "3. Use dependency injection: Instead of directly instantiating the concrete classes, use dependency injection to provide the dataset implementation to the client code. This allows you to easily switch between different dataset implementations without modifying the client code. For example, you can pass an instance of the dataset implementation to a client class through its constructor or a setter method.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Program to the interface: In your client code, program to the interface rather than the concrete implementation. This means that you should use the methods and properties defined in the interface to interact with the dataset, rather than relying on specific implementation details. This allows you to decouple the client code from the dataset implementation and makes it easier to switch between different implementations.\n",

      "1. Use meaningful table and column aliases: Instead of using generic aliases like \"t1\" or \"c1\", provide more descriptive aliases that reflect the purpose of the table or column. For example, instead of \"SELECT t1.name FROM customers AS t1\", use \"SELECT customer.name FROM customers AS customer\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Indentation and formatting: Proper indentation and formatting can greatly enhance the readability of your SQL codes. Use consistent spacing and line breaks to separate different clauses and make the code easier to follow. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   SELECT\n",
      "       customer.name,\n",

      "   WHERE\n",
      "       customer.age > 18\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Comment your code: Add comments to explain the purpose or logic behind complex queries or specific sections of your code. This can help other team members understand your code and make future updates or modifications easier. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   -- Retrieve the names and emails of customers above 18 years old\n",

      "   WHERE\n",
      "       customer.age > 18\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use explicit JOIN syntax: Instead of using implicit joins, use explicit JOIN syntax to make the relationships between tables more apparent. This can improve the clarity of your code and make it easier to understand the logic behind the query. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   SELECT\n",
